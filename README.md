# Crude Server

Minimal HTTP server written in Python for learning purpose.

This is a supplementary code repo for a tutorial I wrote: [Writing an HTTP server from scratch][1].


## Running the server

Execute the `main.py` file. Example on Linux/Mac:

```sh
$ python main.py
```

Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html` from your browser.
